            <p>
              Hi there, I'm Hunter, a driven web developer with a passion for aesthetic UI, 
              server side processing, and web animation. Iâ€™ve been working as a software 
              developer during the past 3 years for James Madison University. In that time I've developed and pushed many projects
              from beginning to end, collaborated with customers and coworkers in a team setting, written detailed documentation, 
              use code versioning tools, and test products thoroughly for quality assurance.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also completed CareerFoundry's
              Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. During my time at the bootcamp, I spent upwards of 30
              hours a week for 8 months learning web development, along side my full time job at JMU. The course started
              from the basics of HTML and CSS all the way to a full stack web application using Node.js, a hand built API, 
              and MongoDB backend with a React and Bootstrap UI frontend. My projects are located above, please take a look. 
              With my years of coding experience prior to this course and my current knowledge of web development, I can offer 
              a large array of skills to any project.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wife, and our great dane Zeus. We all enjoy hiking in the 
              Appalachian range or sitting around the campfire together. I have a 1985 motorcycle that I've been repairing and retrofitting 
              as a hobby. I get to occasionally ride it when it's in the mood. I also enjoy 3D modeling with Blender 
              to make photorealistic models. Finally, not surprisingly, I love coding and creating immersive apps outside of work.
